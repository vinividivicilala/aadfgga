## Cool use cases for gh gists with alias

Create gist

```bash
gh gist create example.txt
```

Every gist you created have an id, we need this id to edit gist. To grap the id or to view all gists you created just run this command,

```bash
gh gist list
```

Then you can edit gist

```bash
gh gist edit xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Quickly access info for example you can but you small code snippets, google fonts & libraries links to quickly copy and past them, save some nice color values, install instructions, etc. save whatever your need and quickly jump on it

```bash
alias links='gh gist edit xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

After run command it will open your gist in default editor for example in windows is notepad, but you can configure github-cli to use you [favorite editor](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_config_set)

For linux & mac you can add alias to ./.bashrc or ./zshrc for windows you can also add alias to ./.bashrc or ./zshrc if you installed [wsl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or to git bash [How to add alias to git bash on windows](https://dev.to/mhjaafar/git-bash-on-windows-adding-a-permanent-alias-198g)

## Bonus Tip:

Make a prompt alias before permanently gone

```bash
rm -rf -i
```
